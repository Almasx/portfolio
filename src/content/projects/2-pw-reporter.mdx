    I developed a Playwright test reporter to improve the debugging workflow for
    over 30 developers. This included integrating the reporter into the CI
    pipeline and addressing the challenge of sorting through a large volume of
    tests, along with implementing custom Yandex-specific features. The project
    went through three design iterations for optimal functionality. Currently,
    itâ€™s under NDA but is planned to be open-sourced in the future, at which
    point the code will be made available.
