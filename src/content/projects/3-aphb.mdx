    I developed a responsive marketing website for the Almaty Physics
    Battle(Inactive), which attracted over 1000 applications. The site was built
    using Astro.js and Tailwind CSS. It includes detailed event information and
    a custom application form. This project was done in collaboration with
    Beyond Curriculum, a leading Olympiad community in Kazakhstan, with whom
    I've worked on multiple projects.
